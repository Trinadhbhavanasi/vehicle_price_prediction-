# vehicle_price_prediction- 🚗💰
This project aims to predict the price of a vehicle based on various attributes such as brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission type, and other relevant features. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this model helps potential buyers and sellers make informed pricing decisions.

Features
✅ Data preprocessing and feature engineering
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✅ Machine learning model training and evaluation
✅ Price prediction based on user inputs
✅ Visualization of model performance
